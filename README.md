## About The Project
This project was a play on a recipes application that allowed users to created accounts and login to an online database. Once their account was created, they could upload cocktail recipes which would be populated in the main homepage.

### A user is presented with the login screen when they reach the home url:
- Custom background imaging and fonts were included throughout the project.

### They can navigate over to the Registration screen if needed to register first:
- The code includes custom validation checks for both the login and registration of new users in the users model.

### This is the main dashboard display:
- SQL statments return cocktails from the database in the order that they were registered, with the oldest recipe cards being returned first.

### Custom filtering based on main spirit specified in search bar:
- Implemented some custom Javascript for filting of cards displayed on the dashboard.

### Create screen for a new entry to be added into the database:
- Custom form field validators needed to be able to register a new drink.

### View of other users account and the cocktails they created: 
- Filters out by user and returns a table of their drinks.

### Can delete or updated your cocktail recipe cards only:
- Coded in a way that the application checks if the users id who is logged in is the one who created the recipe card. If so they can edit and or delete.
